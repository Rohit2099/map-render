## Map Renderer
This was implemented as part of an assignment from the SnapTrude team.

## Requirements
Create a ReactJS app (MERN stack) to get the user to choose a location on a map (use Google Maps or Mapbox), display the region visible in the map and then on the click of a button, capture the visible region in the map as an image and apply it as a material (texture) to a 3D cuboid using BabylonJs.

## Features 
- Authentication/Session management
- Capture Images using Google maps API
- Visualize them as a cuboid
- Visit all the captured images
- Get the top 3 frequently captured images
